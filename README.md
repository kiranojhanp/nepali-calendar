# Nepali Calendar for Obsidian

Hi there! 👋 This plugin brings the **Bikram Sambat (BS)** calendar system right into Obsidian. It's designed to help you manage your daily notes using Nepali dates, making it perfect for anyone who organizes their life around the BS calendar.

## Features

-   **Interactive Calendar**: A clean, native-feeling calendar view showing Bikram Sambat dates alongside Gregorian months.
-   **Daily Notes**: Click any date to open or create a daily note for that Nepali date. It works just like the core Daily Notes plugin but for BS!
-   **Visual Cues**: See at a glance which days have notes (marked with dots) and easily spot today's date.
-   **Customizable**: Choose your date format, note location, and start of the week.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Calendar**: Click the calendar icon 📅 in the ribbon or run "Open Nepali Calendar" from the command palette.
2. **Navigate**: Use the arrows to switch months or jump back to "Today".
3. **Manage Notes**: Click a day to open its note. If it doesn't exist, you'll be prompted to create it.
    - _Tip_: Ctrl/Cmd + Click opens the note in a new pane.
